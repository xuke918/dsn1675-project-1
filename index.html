<p class="name">Ke Xu<p>
<p>My name is Ke Xu. I am a second year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I studied drawing for several years in China. And I joined a lot of drawing contests and won most of them. I have three monthsâ€™ working experience in the newspaper as an editor in 2015 in the summer. I am working as a volunteer in a studio to teach children how to draw. As a graphic design student, I put my whole energy into learning this program. I'm interested in graphic design, and I'm going to learn more from college.</p>
